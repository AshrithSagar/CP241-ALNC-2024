\section*{Problem 3}

Consider the system
\begin{equation*}
    \dot{x}_{1}=x_{1}\left\{\left[\sin \left(\frac{\pi x_{2}}{2}\right)\right]^{2}-1\right\}, \quad \dot{x}_{2}=-x_{2}+u
\end{equation*}
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item With \( u=0 \), show that the origin is globally asymptotically stable.
    \item Show that for bounded input \( u(t) \), the state \( x(t) \) is bounded.
    \item With \( u(t)=1, x_{1}(0)=a, x_{2}(0)=1 \), show that solution is \( x(t)=[a, 1]^{\top} \).
    \item Is the system input-to-state stable?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{(a) Global asymptotic stability of the origin}

\subsubsection*{(b) Bounded input, Bounded output}

\subsubsection*{(c) Solution with \( u(t)=1, \; x_{1}(0)=a, \; x_{2}(0)=1 \)}

\subsubsection*{(d) Input-to-state stability}
