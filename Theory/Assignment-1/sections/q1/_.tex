\section*{Problem 1}

\(M_1\) and \(M_2\) denote point masses; \(K_1, K_2, K\) denote spring constants; and \(x_1,x_2\) denote the displacements of the masses \(M_1\) and \(M_2\).
Use the Hamiltonian formulation of dynamical systems described above to derive a system of first-order ordinary differential equations that characterize this system.
Verify your answer by using Newton's second law of motion to derive the same system of equations.
Assume that \(x_1(0), \dot x_1(0), x_2(0)\), and \(\dot x_2(0)\) are given.
