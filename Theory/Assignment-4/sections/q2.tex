\section*{Problem 2}

Prove the following result:
If the system \( \dot{x}=A x \) is Asymptotically Stable, then for any \( C<0 \), the unique solution to the matrix equation \( A^{\top} P+P A=C \) is given by:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:1}
    P=-\int_{t=0}^{\infty} e^{A^{\top} t} C e^{A t} d t \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
Also, the solution \( P \) is positive definite and symmetric.
Show the proof systematically using the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item Show that the Integral~\ref{eq:1} is finite.
    \item Show that the Matrix P in 1 satisfies Lyapunov Equation
    \item Show that the Matrix P in 1 is symmetric.
    \item Show that the Matrix P in 1 is positive definite.
    \item Show that, if \( \dot{x}=A x \) is asymptotically stable, then the Lyapunov equation has a unique solution. \\
          \textit{Hint:} Use contradiction method. Assume another solution \( \bar{P} \) and show \( \bar{P}=P \)
\end{enumerate}
