\section*{Problem 4}

Consider the system \( x(k+1)=A x(k)+B u(k) \) with \( x(0)=x_{0}, k \geq 0 \).
Determine conditions under which there exists a sequence of inputs so that the state remains at \( x_{0} \), i.e., so that \( x(k)=x_{0} \) for all \( k \geq 0 \).
How is this input sequence determined?
Apply your method to the specific case:
\[
    A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
            2 & 0  \\
            0 & -1
        \end{array}\right], B=\left[\begin{array}{l}
            1 \\
            1
        \end{array}\right], x_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
            -2 \\
            1
        \end{array}\right]
\]
